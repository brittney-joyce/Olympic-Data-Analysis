some of its most notorious crashes, have come from the mind of Travis Pastrana. The global icon often encourages his fellow riders to go big or go home. In some cases, despite their better judgment! Now, with the You Got This tour, Travis and company ramp up the action for the greatest, stupidest, funniest show in Nitros history. You Got This will feature Travis along with Nitros best athletes in FMX, BMX, Scooter and Inline, including X Games medalists and Nitro World Games champions. Its new production will debut huge ramps and crazy contraptions. Expect ridiculous stunts and sketchy challenges. Who will take them up? With this crew you never know what will happen.
